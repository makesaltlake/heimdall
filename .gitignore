# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

# Ignore board backup and rescue files (the symbols will be present in the
# cache files which are *not* ignored)
hardware/**/*-bak
hardware/**/*-rescue.*

# Ignore Visual Studio Code IDE artifacts
.vscode

# Ignore Gerber files generated from board definitions. At some point we may
# want to commit those so that others can order the boards without having to
# export the definitions from KiCad themselves, but today is not that day.
