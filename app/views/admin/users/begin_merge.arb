# Hack of the century: activeadmin_addons's search select requires the field
# it's named after actually exist on the model so that it can attempt to
# extract a default value, and it requires the field name be an actual
# association on the model or else be named after a model class that really
# exists. For that reason we have to call the field below `user_id` and we
# have to add this dummy `user_id` method onto the resource we hand to the
# form. We really should submit an upstream PR to activeadmin_addons to fix
# this.
